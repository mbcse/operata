# Character Generation Implementation

This document summarizes the implementation of character generation in the Eliza Generator Agent.

## Overview

We've implemented a focused approach to character generation using Zod schemas. This ensures that the LLM generates character files that conform to the required structure.

## Key Components

1. **AgentTools.ts**
   - Defines two specialized tools:
     - `generate_character_file`: Generates a character file using the schema structure
     - `get_character_schema`: Returns the character schema as a string

2. **LLMModelManager.ts**
   - Updated to support binding tools to LLM models
   - Provides methods to enable/disable tools

3. **AgentServer.ts**
   - Updated to enable tools by default
   - Implements a structured approach to character generation
   - Uses the Zod schema directly as input to the tool
   - Fixes the character file template creation to match the database schema

## Character Generation Process

The character generation process works as follows:

1. The LLM generates structured character data based on the user's message and context
2. The structured data is streamed as chunks
3. The chunks are collected to build the complete character data
4. The complete character data is passed to the character generation tool
5. The tool validates the data against the CharacterSchema
6. If validation succeeds, the character file is saved to the database
7. If validation fails, detailed error messages are logged

## Benefits of Using Zod Schema Directly

By using the Zod schema directly as input to the tool:

1. **Type Safety**: The tool accepts structured input that matches the schema
2. **Validation**: The input is validated against the schema before being used
3. **Simplicity**: The LLM doesn't need to generate JSON directly, just provide the required fields
4. **Error Prevention**: Common errors like missing required fields are caught early

## Additional Benefits

This implementation provides several benefits:

1. **Schema-Based Validation**: Uses Zod schemas to define and enforce the character structure
2. **Detailed Error Messages**: Provides specific error messages for validation failures
3. **Automatic Integration**: Tools are automatically bound to LLM models
4. **Focused Approach**: Specialized tools for character generation
5. **Stream Processing**: Works with streaming responses from the LLM

## Usage

The LLM can use these tools to:

1. Get the character schema to understand the required structure
2. Generate character files that conform to the schema
3. Fix validation errors in character files

This helps ensure that the generated character files are correctly structured and can be properly processed by the application.
